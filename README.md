🍕📊 PizzaHut Sales Analysis Project — SQL in Action! 📈💻

Thrilled to share one of my latest data projects! I recently analyzed PizzaHut's sales data using SQL to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and performance metrics from thousands of customer orders.

💡 This project involved:

Writing 13+ SQL queries on real-world structured datasets

Extracting insights related to total orders, revenue, popular pizza types & sizes, and category-wise performance

Understanding peak order hours, daily order trends, and cumulative revenue growth over time

🧩 Some questions I tackled using SQL:
• What’s the total number of orders and revenue generated?
• Which is the highest-priced pizza and the most frequently ordered pizza size?
• What are the top 5 most ordered pizza types?
• How do pizza categories perform in terms of quantity and revenue?
• What’s the distribution of orders by hour, and what trends appear across days?
• Which pizzas bring in the highest revenue both overall and within their categories?

🛠️ Tools Used:

SQL (MySQL / SQLite / PostgreSQL)

DB Browser / DBeaver

PowerPoint for final presentation

📊 This hands-on project improved my skills in:

Writing complex SQL queries with joins, aggregates, and subqueries

Translating raw data into actionable business insights

Structuring and presenting findings in a clean, digestible format
